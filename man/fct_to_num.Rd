\title{Factor As Numeric}
\usage{
fct_to_num(f)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{factor to be converted to numeric values}
}
\value{
Numeric
}
\description{
Transform a factor to approximately its original numeric values.
}
\details{
See \sQuote{Warning} section of \code{\link[base]{factor}}: \dQuote{In particular, \code{as.numeric}
applied to a factor is meaningless, and may happen by implicit coercion. To transform a factor
\code{f} to approximately its original numeric values, \code{as.numeric(levels(f))[f]} is
recommended and slightly more efficient than \code{as.numeric(as.character(f))}.} Accordingly,
\code{fct_to_num()} implements this method.
}
\examples{
f <- factor(2001:2020) |> print()  ## Create sequence of numeric values as a factor
levels(f) |> str()                 ## Seemingly numeric levels are actually character strings! 
f |> as.numeric()               ## Returns codes for factor levels, not what was expected
f |> fct_to_num()               ## Returns numeric values equivalent to factor levels
